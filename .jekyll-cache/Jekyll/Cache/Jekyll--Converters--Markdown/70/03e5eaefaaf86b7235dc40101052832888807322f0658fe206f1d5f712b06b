I"‹<p>Lizzyâ€™s boss has made her in charge of the Palindrome Accentuator(abbreviated as PA) . Initially you have the string s . The PA does the following 2 operations on the string:</p>

<p><strong>0 i x</strong>  Change the character at the i<sup>th</sup> position to x.</p>

<p><strong>1 l r</strong>  Check whether the substring from l to r is a palindrome or not.</p>

<p>Lizzy has to note down the readings for the boss for queries of type 2 . She is quite perplexed . Can you help her .</p>

<p>More formally, you are given a string s and you have to perform the queries described above . For queries of type 2 , if the substring from l to r is palindrome output â€œYesâ€ and if it isnâ€™t output â€œNoâ€(without quotes).</p>

<p><strong>Inputs</strong><br />
The first line contains N and Q-the length of the string and the number of queries to be answered.The next line contains the string s of N characters.The next Q lines are either of the form <strong>0 i x</strong> or <strong>1 l r</strong> - denoting the queries described above.</p>

<p><strong>Output</strong><br />
For each query of type 2 , output â€œYesâ€ or â€œNoâ€ accordingly , the answer for each query on a new line.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong>  <br />
1&lt;=N&lt;=10<sup>5</sup><br />
1&lt;=Q&lt;=10<sup>5</sup><br />
1&lt;=i , l , r &lt;=N  <br />
All the characters in the input are lowercase letters from â€˜aâ€™ to â€˜zâ€™.</p>
