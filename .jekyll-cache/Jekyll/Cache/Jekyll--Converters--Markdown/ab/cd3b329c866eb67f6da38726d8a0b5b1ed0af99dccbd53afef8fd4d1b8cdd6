<p>Handwriting recognition (or HWR[1]) is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. Machine Learning is incorporated to solve this interesting problem. Using neural networks and optimization the model learns the similarities of the training datasets which have a common result. Spell corrector is also incorporated to increase accuracy upto 97%.</p>

<p>The program was developed on Lua using Torch libraries like image, nn, optim, etc to detect Handwritten text. Given image of a paragraph as input it can segment various lines and then further each line into individual alphabets including spaces and further recognize them. To increase the accuracy of the output, a spell corrector was incorporated in the program. Using a million words from Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle ’s novel and words from dictionary, a database was created, through which recognized words were compared by applying methods like Bayes’ Theorem the correct word was replaced.</p>

<p>A database was made as a table in Torch using only images of alphabets android digits. In order to expand the database, letters were also rotated by +10 degrees and -10 degrees and added to the database hence constituting more than 10,000 training images. More than 500 images were also maintained as test images to check accuracy</p>

<p>Received the <strong>Special Mention</strong> during the Science &amp; Technology Summer Camp 2016.</p>
